## Install

Requires wakeonlan, websocket for python and arp (in Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install net-tools)

    python -m venv lgtv-venv
    source lgtv-venv/bin/activate
    pip install git+https://github.com/klattimer/LGWebOSRemote

## Example usage
    # Scan/Authenticate
    $ lgtv scan
    {
        "count": 1,
        "list": [
            {
                "address": "192.168.1.31",
                "model": "UF830V",
                "uuid": "10f34f86-0664-f223-4b8f-d16a772d9baf"
            }
        ],
        "result": "ok"
    }
    $ lgtv auth 192.168.1.31

    $ lgtv on
    $ lgtv off

    # If you have the youtube plugin
    $ lgtv openYoutubeURL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

    # Otherwise, this works reasonably well
    $ lgtv openBrowserAt https://www.youtube.com/tv#/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

## Caveats

You need to auth with the TV before being able to use the on command as it requires the mac address.

## Bugs

I couldn't test youtube because it seems the app isn't installed and not available to download right now
maybe they're updating it?
